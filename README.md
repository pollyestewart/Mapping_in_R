# Mapping_in_R

The purpose of this repository is to introduce people to working with geospatial data, map visualisations and basic R Shiny dashboards. 

Follow through the code to generate an interactive dashboard with maps at the end!

# Pre-requisities

### Required Skills:
- A basic understanding of R programming

### Data:
The geospatial location we are using as an example is London. There are many different types of geospatial data, and in this we are using a relatively standard Shapefile format. 

The London data store is an amazing open data source that included many different geospatial data sources. For our basic we are going to use basic census/administrative boundaries as polygon shapes. Please download the shapefiles for the following geospatial granularities:

- Boroughs - the largest sub-groups of London and the most recognisable
- Wards - sub-areas within Boroughs
- MSOA - Middle Super Output Areas (MSOAs) are zone within wards
- LSOA - Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) are the smallest London granularities in this project. A useful polygon shape as can be tied back to census data for meaningful insights.

### Tools
I would recommend running this in R Studio
