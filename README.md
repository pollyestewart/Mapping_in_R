# Mapping_in_R

The purpose of this repository is to introduce people to working with geospatial data, map visualisations and basic R Shiny dashboards. 

Follow through the code to generate an interactive dashboard with maps!

# Pre-requisities

### Required Skills:
- A basic understanding of R programming

### Data:
The example geospatial location is London. There are many different types of geospatial data, and in this we are using a relatively standard Shapefile format. 

The London data store is an amazing open data source that includes many different geospatial data sources. We are going to use basic census/administrative boundaries as polygon shapes. Please download the shapefiles for the following geospatial granularities:

- Boroughs - the largest sub-groups of London and the most recognisable
- Wards - sub-areas within Boroughs
- MSOA - Middle Super Output Areas (MSOAs) are zone within wards
- LSOA - Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) are the smallest London granularities in this project. A useful polygon shape as can be tied back to census data for meaningful insights.

### Tools
I would recommend running this in R Studio
